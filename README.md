# Cable Following
## Marcus

This project is designed to have a tactile sensor equipped gripper follow a cable. This is a continuation of the work started in an OSU ROB 537 final project.

### How to use
First, connect the gripper via USB. If using a Docker container, be sure to connect the USB before starting the container (or restart the container).

Launch the gripper bringup with:
```console
roslaunch contactille_gripper gripper_bringup.launch
```
This will identify ports for the Contactille sensors and Dynamixel controlller, and start feedback and control nodes.
